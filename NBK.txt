Debasish Deb, name sounds unfamiliar...?
Well, that's the birth name given to the Shillong based rapper, New Born King aka NBK.
Born on  July 26, 1996, in the vibrant and diverse music culture of Shillong. 

The 26 year old rapper's roots, at a very young age, was enticed by 
an unbounding interest for the western rap culture from the early 2000s. Eminem's 
Encore and Relapse had hit this 13 year old boy hard...!

The seed was laid back then, and here is NBK today, GRINDING HARD and earning recognition!!
The rapper has made a name for himself winning titles in competitions like
Shabdose (a weekly hosted rap competion) and has collaborated with multiple artists
across the state. 

A passion so wild that only success can tame it.
